## Overview

Final Countdown is an application built in `Svelte` that generates synonyms for a keyword. A user can enter a word and Final Countdown will populate buttons for the matching synonyms. Clicking on one of these buttons will create a new list of synonyms. Our bank of words is pulled from the Merriam-Webster's dictionary API.
